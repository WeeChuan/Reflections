What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


To initialize the .git folder for the repository. Without it git would not recognize the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


It acts as a workspace before deciding on the commit officially, thus saving any unwanted/careless commits.

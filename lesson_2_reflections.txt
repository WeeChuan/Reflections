What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


To initialize the .git folder for the repository. Without it git would not recognize the folder.

-----

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


It acts as a workspace before deciding on the commit officially, thus saving any unwanted/careless commits.

-----

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?


The staging area provides the list of changes added to the staging area. So we can use that to check if the current staging area is worthy of a logical commit.


-----

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


Branches could sometimes ‘compile’ the previous versions/branches/nodes as one, making it easier to keep track of.
